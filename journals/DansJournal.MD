I've been doing the front-end work mostly. Ran into some issues that I had to figure out how to resolve. Felt nice when I got passed the issue. Been trying to get the Navbar to display properly. Have been having issues with getting Bootstrap to display features properly. Found out a solution with an import that I needed to remove from what Vite and React had pre imported into a file. Once I removed that it made it look nicer but not 100% the way I want it to look. Showed Preston what I have been working on so he could help with some of the front end material. I have been adding various pages so they are ready to be populated once the backend is ready to go.
I haven't really been spacing my entries out and it's looking a bit messy. Here's an effort to make it look less messy! Nav bar took awhile to get it fixed up to something nice. Decided to scrap all the bootstrap as it was giving me trouble when trying to edit certain parts of it. I replaced it with my own CSS and it looks far nicer than what it was. Started working on a home page and it is almost doing what I want it to do. The picture background is a wee-bit wonky but is still in a satisfactory state. I have a couple more implementations to make to the home page and after that I will be messing around with the workout detail page. Had to fix some merges and got things up to date!
