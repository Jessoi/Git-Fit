I've been doing the front-end work mostly. Ran into some issues that I had to figure out how to resolve. Felt nice when I got passed the issue. Been trying to get the Navbar to display properly. Have been having issues with getting Bootstrap to display features properly. Found out a solution with an import that I needed to remove from what Vite and React had pre imported into a file. Once I removed that it made it look nicer but not 100% the way I want it to look. Showed Preston what I have been working on so he could help with some of the front end material. I have been adding various pages so they are ready to be populated once the backend is ready to go.
