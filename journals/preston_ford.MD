Today I began working on front end jsx files to for the workout endpoints. I hope to have a create workout
page implemented and ready for styling once Daniel pushes some of his CSS files to main.

Finished the CRUD functionality for workouts and arduously merged that to main with the help of Jesse.
I started discussing the plan for the front end with Daniel and decided to work on just creating the very rough
pages without styling so as to diminish merge conflicts and allow him to continue his work unbothered.

Working on frontend implementation of workout pages, Create Workout was finished on 11/22, today I am working on list workouts and hope to finish that as well as the workout detail page.
