Today I began working on front end jsx files to for the workout endpoints. I hope to have a create workout
page implemented and ready for styling once Daniel pushes some of his CSS files to main.

Finished the CRUD functionality for workouts and arduously merged that to main with the help of Jesse.
I started discussing the plan for the front end with Daniel and decided to work on just creating the very rough
pages without styling so as to diminish merge conflicts and allow him to continue his work unbothered.

Working on frontend implementation of workout pages, Create Workout was finished on 11/22, today I am working on list workouts and hope to finish that as well as the workout detail page. Note from end of day: The workout detail page is reliant on exercise instance being fully implemented so I will only be able to work on the create, list and edit pages until Matt finishes that.

Ended up deciding to refactor the SQL table for workouts from just including "userid" and "name" to also include "intensity" and "favorites". I will be refactoring the queries today to reflect the change. I hope to also implement this on the front end today as well and add some css styling for the table of workout data.
